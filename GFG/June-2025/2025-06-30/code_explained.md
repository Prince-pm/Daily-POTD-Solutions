## 🔍 Code Explanation – Step by Step

### 🔧 Function: `canAchieve(h)`
- This checks if we can achieve minimum height `h` using ≤ k watering operations.
- We initialize:
  - `water[]` → difference array (for efficient range updates)
  - `curr` → running prefix sum to track water effect at current index
  - `ops` → total water units used

### 💡 Logic:
- For each flower `i`:
  - Compute actual height = arr[i] + curr
  - If actual < h → calculate how much water needed (delta)
    - Add delta to `ops`
    - Add delta to current prefix
    - Subtract delta after `w` positions in water[]
- Return `True` if total ops ≤ k.

### 🧠 Binary Search:
- Start from `low = min(arr)` to `high = min(arr) + k`
- At each step:
  - If `canAchieve(mid)` → update answer = mid, try higher
  - Else → reduce high

### 📌 Why Difference Array?
- Applying water to w continuous flowers is a range update.
- Difference array allows efficient O(1) update for each range.

### ✅ Final Output:
- The maximum possible minimum height we can achieve after `k` days of smart watering.
