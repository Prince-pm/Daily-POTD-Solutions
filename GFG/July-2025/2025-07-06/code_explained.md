## 🔍 Code Explanation – Step by Step

This problem can be efficiently solved using **Heaps (Priority Queues)** and sorting.

---

### 🔧 Step 1: Sort Both Arrays

- Sort array `a` and `b` in **descending order**.
- This ensures that the largest elements are considered first when forming sums.

---

### 🔄 Step 2: Use a Max Heap

- Use a max heap (implemented via a min heap with negative values) to store potential combinations.
- Each element in the heap is a tuple:  
  `(-sum, i, j)` → where `sum = a[i] + b[j]`.

---

### ➕ Step 3: Push Initial Combination

- Push the sum of the **largest elements**: `a[0] + b[0]` into the heap.
- Also push its index pair `(0, 0)` into a `visited` set to avoid duplication.

---

### 🔁 Step 4: Extract Top K Elements

- While `k > 0` and heap is not empty:
  - Pop the top of the heap (which has the current max sum).
  - Append the positive sum to result list.
  - Push next two combinations:
    - `(i + 1, j)` and `(i, j + 1)` (if within bounds and not visited yet).
    - These are the next best candidates in a row/column.

---

### 🧾 Step 5: Return Result

- After collecting `k` combinations, return the result list.

---

### 📌 Important Notes

- The heap ensures we always get the next largest combination.
- The `visited` set avoids pushing duplicate index pairs into the heap.
- Sorting the arrays first guarantees the top-down exploration of maximum sums.
