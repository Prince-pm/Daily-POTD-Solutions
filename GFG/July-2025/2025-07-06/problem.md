### 🧩 Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `a[]` and `b[]` of equal size.  
A **sum combination** is formed by adding one element from `a[]` and one from `b[]`.  
Each index pair `(i, j)` can be used at most once.

Your task is to return the **top `k` maximum sum combinations**, sorted in **non-increasing order**.

### 🔒 Constraints

- 1 ≤ `a.length` = `b.length` ≤ 10⁵  
- 1 ≤ `k` ≤ a.length  
- 1 ≤ `a[i], b[i]` ≤ 10⁴
