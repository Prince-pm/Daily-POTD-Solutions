### 🧩 Problem Statement

You are given an array `arr[]` of integers. Your task is to select any two indices `i` and `j` such that `i < j`.  
From the subarray `arr[i...j]`, find the **smallest** and **second smallest** elements.  
Add these two numbers to get the **score** of that subarray.

Your goal is to return the **maximum score** that can be obtained from any subarray of `arr[]` with length at least 2.

### 🔒 Constraints

- 2 ≤ `arr.length` ≤ 10⁵  
- 1 ≤ `arr[i]` ≤ 10⁶
