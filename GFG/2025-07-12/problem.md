### ðŸ§© Problem Statement

You are given a 2D matrix `mat[][]` representing a gold mine. Each cell contains a positive integer which is the amount of gold in tons.

The miner can start from **any row in the first column**, and can move in any of the following directions **from a given cell**:

- Move to the **right** cell â†’ `(i, j + 1)`
- Move to the **right-up** diagonal â†’ `(i - 1, j + 1)`
- Move to the **right-down** diagonal â†’ `(i + 1, j + 1)`

The miner keeps collecting gold as he moves until he can no longer move.

Your task is to determine the **maximum amount of gold** that the miner can collect.
