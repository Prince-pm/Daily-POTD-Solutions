# 🧠 Daily POTD Solutions – LeetCode & GeeksforGeeks

Welcome to my repository of **Daily Problem of the Day (POTD)** solutions from **LeetCode** and **GeeksforGeeks**.

This is not just a code dump – each problem is deeply documented with:
- 🧠 **Concept explanation**
- 🔍 **Step-by-step code explanation**
- 💻 **Clean and optimized solution**

This repo is designed to help both myself and others strengthen **DSA**, **problem-solving**, and **interview prep** in a structured, consistent way.
