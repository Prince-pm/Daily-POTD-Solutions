# 🧠 Daily POTD Solutions – LeetCode & GeeksforGeeks

Welcome to my repository of **Daily Problem of the Day (POTD)** solutions from **LeetCode** (in C++) and **GeeksforGeeks** (in Python 3).  
Each problem includes not only the solution, but also the **concept** behind the approach and a **step-by-step code explanation**, making it easier for learners to understand and revise.
