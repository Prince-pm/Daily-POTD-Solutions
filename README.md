# 🧠 Daily POTD Solutions – LeetCode & GeeksforGeeks

Welcome to my repository of **Daily Problem of the Day (POTD)** solutions from **LeetCode** and **GeeksforGeeks**.

This is not just a code dump – each problem is deeply documented with:
- 🧠 **Concept explanation**
- 🔍 **Step-by-step code explanation**
- 💻 **Clean and optimized solution**

This repo is designed to help both myself and others strengthen **DSA**, **problem-solving**, and **interview prep** in a structured, consistent way.

## 📋 `problem.md` – Problem Statement

This file contains a **clean summary** of the original problem:
- Platform (LeetCode or GFG)
- Problem link
- Sample inputs and outputs
- Rewritten or summarized question (optional)

**🎯 Purpose**: Understand what the question is asking without visiting the original platform.

---

## 💡 `concept_explained.md` – Concept Explanation

This file explains the **main idea** behind the solution, such as:
- Hash Maps, Sliding Window, Binary Search, DP, Greedy, etc.
- Why this technique fits the problem
- Time and Space complexity analysis

**🎯 Purpose**: Helps understand the **“why”** before diving into the code.

---

## 🔍 `code_explained.md` – Code Walkthrough

This file provides a **step-by-step breakdown** of the code:
- What each line or block does
- Reasoning behind conditionals, loops, and data structures
- Alternate ideas (if any)

**🎯 Purpose**: Learn the **“how”** in detail — perfect for revision and beginners.
