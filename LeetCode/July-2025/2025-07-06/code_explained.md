## 🔍 Code Explanation – Step by Step

This problem combines **data structure design** with **frequency maps (hashmaps)**.

### 🧱 Step 1: Initialize the Object

- Store `nums1` and `nums2` in member variables.
- Build a frequency map `freq2` for elements in `nums2` to track counts.
- This helps in quickly answering count queries.

---

### ➕ Step 2: Add Operation

- When `add(index, val)` is called:
  - Decrease the count of `nums2[index]` in the `freq2` map.
  - Update the value of `nums2[index]`.
  - Increase the count of the new value in `freq2`.

This keeps our frequency map up to date after any addition operation.

### 🔄 Step 3: Count Operation

- When `count(tot)` is called:
  - Iterate over each value `a` in `nums1`.
  - For each `a`, compute `target = tot - a`.
  - Use the frequency map to get `freq2[target]`.
  - Add this frequency to the result.

This efficiently calculates the number of valid `(i, j)` pairs without iterating over the entire `nums2`.

### ⚙️ Why It Works

- `nums1` is small (≤ 1000), so we can afford iterating over it.
- `nums2` can be large, so we avoid iterating it by using a frequency map.
- Updates via `add()` are reflected in the map so `count()` remains accurate.

### 🧮 Time & Space Complexity

- `add(index, val)`: **O(1)**  
- `count(tot)`: **O(n₁)** where n₁ = size of `nums1`
- `Space`: **O(n₂)** for the frequency map
