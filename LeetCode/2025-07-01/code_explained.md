## 🔍 Code Explanation – Step by Step

### 🔧 Step 1: Grouping the Characters

- We scan through the string and group consecutive identical characters together.
- For example, "abbcccc" will be grouped as:
  - ['a', 1], ['b', 2], ['c', 4]
- This helps identify all stretches that may have resulted from a long press.

### ➕ Step 2: Count Possible Reductions

- For each group:
  - If the length is ≥ 2, Alice might have intended a shorter version of it.
  - You can reduce the length by 1, 2, ..., up to `(length - 1)` characters.
- Each such group contributes `(length - 1)` possible variants.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Return the Total Possibilities

- We start with a base of 1 to count the original typed string itself.
- Then, for each reducible group, we add its `(length - 1)` to the total.
- The sum is the total number of possible original strings Alice might have typed.

### 📌 Important Note:

- Since Alice is allowed to make this mistake **only once**, we apply possible reductions only to one group at a time — but summing for all of them works since we're considering **each as the possible one group** she messed up on.
