## 🔍 Code Explanation – Step by Step

This solution uses **bottom-up dynamic programming** and **binary search** to optimize finding compatible events.

---

### 🔧 Step 1: Sort Events by End Time

- Events are sorted by their `endDay` to allow binary search for the most recent non-overlapping event.
- Sorting ensures we can scan from left to right and build up the solution incrementally.

---

### 📦 Step 2: Initialize DP Table

- `dp[i][j]` represents the max value achievable by using the first `i` events and attending up to `j` events.
- Table size: `(n+1) x (k+1)`.

---

### 🔍 Step 3: Binary Search for Compatible Event

- For each event `i`, find the largest index `h` such that:
  - `events[h].endDay < events[i].startDay`
- This ensures no overlap between `h` and `i`.

---

### 🔁 Step 4: Fill DP Table

- For each event `i` and count `j` (1 to k):
  - **Skip Event `i`**: `dp[i+1][j] = dp[i][j]`
  - **Take Event `i`**: `dp[i+1][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[h][j-1] + value[i])`
    - where `h` is the last compatible event found by binary search.

---

### ✅ Step 5: Return Answer

- Final answer is `dp[n][k]` → maximum value using any `k` events among all `n`.

---

### 📌 Notes

- This is a **classic weighted interval scheduling** problem optimized with binary search.
- DP ensures subproblems are reused, and binary search allows faster look-up of compatible events.
