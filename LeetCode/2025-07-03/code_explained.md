## 🔍 Code Explanation – Step by Step

This problem is a **string simulation** problem based on repeated self-expansion of a pattern through character shifting.

---

### 🔧 Step 1: Start with the Initial Word

- We begin with the string `word = "a"`.
- This is the starting point of the iterative construction process.

---

### 🔄 Step 2: Repeat Operations Until Length ≥ k

- We continue applying the transformation until the length of the string becomes at least `k`.
- In each operation:
  - We traverse the entire current `word`.
  - For every character, we compute its **next character** in the alphabet.
  - If the character is `'z'`, it wraps around to `'a'`.

---

### ➕ Step 3: Generate the New Suffix

- After converting each character to its next one, we store this new string separately.
- This new string is the **suffix** to be appended to the original.
- For example:
  - From `"a"` → generate `"b"`
  - Append to get `"ab"`

---

### 📌 Step 4: Append and Grow the Word

- The generated suffix is appended to the current word.
- This effectively doubles the word size with modified characters on the right half.
- We continue this process until the total word length is **greater than or equal to `k`**.

---

### 🎯 Step 5: Extract the kth Character

- Once the word has enough characters, we return the character at index `k - 1` (since indexing is 0-based).
- This gives us the desired answer directly.

---

### 📌 Important Notes

- Since the constraint is small (`k ≤ 500`), this brute-force simulation is both time and space efficient.
- The structure of the string follows a deterministic pattern: self followed by its incremented version.
- There's no need for complex data structures or optimizations.
