## 🔍 Code Explanation – Step by Step

This problem is a **combinatorics + dynamic programming** based variant of string processing.

---

### 🔧 Step 1: Group the Characters

- Traverse the `word` and compress consecutive repeating characters into groups.
- Each group is represented by its character and its count.
- For example, for `word = "aabbbcc"`, we group it as:
  - ['a', 2], ['b', 3], ['c', 2]
- This grouping identifies stretches where Alice may have accidentally held a key too long.

---

### 🔄 Step 2: Initialize the DP Array

- We initialize a 1D DP array `dp` of size `(k + max_total_possible_length + 1)` to track ways to reach different original string lengths.
- `dp[0] = 1` — base case (one way to form an empty string).
- All other values are initially set to 0.

---

### ➕ Step 3: Process Each Group

- For each group of size `g`, we simulate pressing the key 1 to `g` times.
- For every length `used` so far (from back to front to avoid overcounting), we:
  - Add `dp[used]` to `dp[used + x]` for all `x` in `[1, g]`
  - This models adding `x` characters from this group to previously valid strings.

---

### 📈 Step 4: Accumulate All Valid Answers

- After processing all groups, the DP array contains counts of ways to build strings of all possible lengths.
- We sum up all `dp[len]` for `len ≥ k`.
- This gives the number of original strings of valid size (at least `k`), modulo `10^9 + 7`.

---

### 📌 Important Notes

- Modulo `10^9 + 7` is used throughout to avoid integer overflow.
- Only one pass through the `word` and DP updates are needed → ensures performance for large inputs.
- The DP array size is optimized to be just enough to hold the possible lengths up to total characters in `word`.
