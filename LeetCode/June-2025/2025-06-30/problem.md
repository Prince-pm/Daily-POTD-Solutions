### 🧩 Problem Statement

We define a **harmonious array** as an array where the **difference between the maximum and minimum values is exactly 1**.

Given an array `nums`, return the **length of its longest harmonious subsequence**.

⚠️ A *subsequence* is formed by deleting some elements **without changing the order** of the remaining elements.

### 🔒 Constraints

- 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10⁴  
- -10⁹ <= nums[i] <= 10⁹
